class BaseUnitOfWork(ABC):
    """
    Base class for implementing the Unit of Work pattern.

    This class manages the lifecycle of a SQLAlchemy async session and provides
    transactional control methods such as commit and rollback. It is designed
    to be used as an asynchronous context manager.

    The class is intentionally abstract and must not be instantiated directly.
    Concrete Unit of Work implementations should inherit from this class and
    initialize domain-specific repositories inside their constructors.

    Example:
        class UserUnitOfWork(BaseUnitOfWork):
            def __init__(
                self,
                session: AsyncSession,
                user_repository: UserRepository,
                # other repositories if needed
            ) -> None:
                super().__init__(session)
                self.users = user_repository

            def _uow_marker(self) -> None: ...

        async with UserUnitOfWork(session) as uow:
            await uow.users.create(user_data)
            await uow.commit()

    Attributes:
        _session:
            Active SQLAlchemy asynchronous session used by repositories.

    Notes:
        - On successful execution, the session is simply closed.
        - If an exception occurs inside the context manager block,
          the transaction is rolled back automatically.
        - Repositories should reuse the same session instance provided
          by the Unit of Work.
